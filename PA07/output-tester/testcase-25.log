Testcase 25
   Testing List_merge(lhs, rhs, compar), where:
   
   + compar is: return strlen(a) - strlen(b)
   + lhs is: "a" ==> "be" ==> "sea" ==> NULL
   + rhs is: "deee" ==> NULL
   
   2) lhs  : 79937920 rhs 79937600 stor = 1
   2) lhs  : 79938080 rhs 79937600 stor = -1
   2) lhs  : 79937760 rhs 79937600 stor = -1
   merged is  : "a" ==> "be" ==> "sea" ==> "deee" ==> NULL
   solution is: "a" ==> "be" ==> "sea" ==> "deee" ==> NULL
Pass.
