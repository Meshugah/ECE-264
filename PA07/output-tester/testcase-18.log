Testcase 18
   Testing List_merge(lhs, rhs, compar), where:
   
   + compar is: return strcmp(a, b)
   + lhs is: "b" ==> "d" ==> "f" ==> NULL
   + rhs is: "a" ==> "c" ==> "e" ==> "g" ==> "h" ==> "i" ==> "j" ==> NULL
   
   2) lhs  : 79938720 rhs 79937600 stor = 1
   2) lhs  : 79938880 rhs 79937600 stor = 1
   2) lhs  : 79939040 rhs 79937600 stor = -1
   merged is  : "b" ==> "d" ==> "f" ==> "a" ==> "c" ==> "e" ==> "g" ==> "h" ==> "i" ==> "j" ==> NULL
   solution is: "a" ==> "b" ==> "c" ==> "d" ==> "e" ==> "f" ==> "g" ==> "h" ==> "i" ==> "j" ==> NULL
